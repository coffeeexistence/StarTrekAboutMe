      Fantastic news! Whiz Tutor for Tutors has been released for both <a href>Android</a> and <a href>iOS Devices</a>. I've spent many long days and nights, crafting this
      into the vision of the Whiz Tutor team, as well as my own.  It has been a long and wild ride, and this part of my journey has been completed.
      <br><br>
      Here's a <a href>Video Tutorial</a> which goes through the app, it's features, and the overall feel/experience.

      An amazing opportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants and integrate modern web technologies with the capabilities of this generation's smartphones.
      <br><br>
      I am building this with Ionic, Angular, and Cordova. I love obsessing over details and beholding how they compound into something that just 'feels right'.
      Whether that means putting love into the timing functions of my ui components' animations, making sure things look pixel-perfect, disabling fancier animations for
      lower end android users specifically, or making sure that internal logic stays performant.
